# IMPORTANT: Swift Package Manager does NOT support Git LFS
# SPM performs shallow clones that don't fetch LFS objects
# Files that SPM needs to check out the package MUST NOT be tracked by LFS
# 
# This package uses binaryTarget with URLs pointing to GitHub releases,
# so binary frameworks are downloaded, not stored in the repo

# CRITICAL: Exclude all files that SPM needs from LFS
# These files must be regular Git files, not LFS pointers
